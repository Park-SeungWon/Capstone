(A)                 When Sheila was walking near her house, she
                                                                        Sheila는 Max가 책상 밑에 앉아 있는 것을 보았다.
                saw a poster about the lost cat. She read it closely,
                and her eyes got big. " This cat looks exactly like
                Max. It's so strange." She hurried home. "Come on,                    → Sheila _________________________________.
                Max! Let's go!". She took him to the address on the                      (the desk / Max / under / sitting / saw)
                poster.
(B) " Let me guess," said Sheila. "Your cat comes
    home only in the evenings, doesn't he?" Ryan
    nodded. " And you lost him last Friday, don't
    you?" Sheila said. "Yes! How did you know?" said                    27. zb27)

    Ryan. "Because this is my cat, too, and he usually                     시오.
                                                                           시오.

(C) "Ding-Dong." When Ryan heard the doorbell ring, he
    ran to the door and opened it. "Bear, you're back!"
                                                                                      → _____________________________________?
    Ryan cried. Max jumped up into Ryan's arms.
                                                                                         (you / make / 5 / p.m. / it / can / at)
(D) "Our cat has two families!" said Ryan. "Hey,        if
    you have time, please come in and have some
    cookies." "Sure," said. Sheila. "Thank you, Max," she
    thought. "I met a good neighbor thanks to you!"
